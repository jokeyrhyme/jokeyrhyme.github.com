### What is Godus?

Godus is a video game currently in development by [22cans](http://www.22cans.com/), spear-headed by [Peter Molyneux](https://twitter.com/pmolyneux). I backed it [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/22cans/project-godus) and have been playing the early-access open-beta version ever since.

From the Kickstarter pledge:

> Populous was created over 22 years ago, and we believe that to date, nothing has come close to emulating its powerfully godlike experience. Itâ€™s this experience we aim to reimagine. GODUS blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White. The original Populous hailed from the 8-bit era but GODUS will use the most modern technology the world has to offer.

You can find Godus [on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/232810/) for both OS X and Windows, although iOS and Android will eventually be supported.

### Godus 1.3.1

I posted a preview / rant [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/+RonWaldon/posts/Uf7A44P6sGd) after playing through version 1.3.1. The update unlocked a whole new era of gameplay, but the gameplay seemed to regress.

### Godus 2.0.4

I've been playing the following free-to-play pay-to-win games on my [Nexus 5](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_5_black_32gb):

- [Clash of Clans](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans)

- [Dungeon Keeper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.dungeonkeeper_row)

These games have me in a fairly convenient pattern: play the game for a few minutes, come back in a few hours, repeat.

Godus almost has a similar pattern, although it's on a slightly larger scale. I play it for an hour or so: sculpting the land, establishing settlements, and directing my followers. Then I leave the computer while my followers finish their tasks.

I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. It's just ... weird. I would not recommend this for someone looking for an action game, let's put it that way.

#### The Good

This game already scratches my [Populous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous) itch quite well. The Voyage of Discovery mode also has a bit of a [Lemmings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)) feel to it. According to Steam, I've played nearly 80 hours of Godus so far. Clearly, I find the game compelling enough to lose this much time.

The basic mechanics are solid: flatten the ground, build houses, build settlements, collect resources, expand. If this was all the game offered, this would make for a fun sandbox experience on a smartphone or tablet.

#### The Bad

Civilisation cards can be completed in any order (assuming prerequisites are met). However, this doesn't seem like an especially meaningful choice.

Stickers.

#### The Ugly

The game still occasionally crashes. Worse, it can corrupt your save game so that you have to start all over again. Luckily, there are [work-around instructions](http://steamcommunity.com/app/232810/discussions/0/558752450398813838/), which I stumbled upon via [this tweet](https://twitter.com/22Cans/status/454100215570890752). As far as "ugly" goes, this isn't a bad situation: a known issue with an impending fix and an interim solution.
