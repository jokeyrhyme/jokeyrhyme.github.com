I got my [Samsung Series 3 Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/samsung-chromebook.html)
from Best Buy (Union Square, New York City). There was a display model
positioned where the Samsung section meets the non-Samsung laptops, which made
some sort of sense. This is a Chromebook of the small and cheap variety.

When I got it back to my hotel room, I fired it up. It initially had Chrome 25
installed, but it eventually updated to Chrome 27 over my possibly-shaped 3.5G
connection.

I did just a little bit of [benchmarking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArwYyf8G8xO8dGpZM0xNMDVIVko2UlNFdlItbFU4bkE#gid=5),
for anyone interested in web standards compliance and performance.

### Chromebooks and Chrome OS

Chromebooks are laptops ranging in size and quality. They can be small and
cheap like the netbooks a decade ago, or they can expensive and glorious like
Google's [Pixel](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel).

Chromebooks run Chrome OS (naturally). Chrome OS is basically a special Linux
distribution that boots up Google's Chrome browser instead of GNOME or KDE. Aura
is a window manager that makes Chrome feel just a little bit more like a
complete environment (like OS X or Windows). It adds a task bar and a launcher.

### The Good

I did have my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7, but it seems the only practical way to get
any news on these devices is via a social network (in my case, Google+). If an
RSS junkie wants to get any real consumption going, a desktop OS is basically
mandatory. Thank goodness for [Feedly](http://feedly.com/).

Performance is fine, especially for the battery life. Browsing the web on the
Chromebook is far smoother and faster than on the Nexus 7. It's also much
quicker to enter text, obviously, via the physical (yet cheap-feeling) keyboard.

Most things that work in Google Chrome work on the Chromebook, even the handy
chrome://flags/ listing of experimental features.

I was able to make the touch pad scroll the same way I've finally become
accustomed too on my MacBook Pro by selecting "Australian scrolling" in
Settings.

The Chromebook came with vouchers for GoGoInFlight Wi-Fi, which I made use of on
my domestic flights. This was a really nice touch. I just wish it was available
on international flights.

### The Bad

The WiFi indicator looks very similar to the one in stock Android. However,
unlike in Android, there are no little blinking up and down triangles to
indicate current activity.

I played an episode of [Zero Punctuation](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation).
The speaker(s) are surprisingly loud, although the Nexus 7 definitely had a
clearer sound. Even when I picked the Chromebook up, it sounded a bit muffled. I
will definitely not be listening to music on this device if I can help it.

I prefer to avoid the physical click action on touchpads. Unfortunately, there's
no way to perform drag-and-drop via touch alone, despite there being an
experimental flag to that effect. The touchpad is also not as smooth as I'd
like, but this isn't a luxury device so I'm willing to let that slide.

Not all NaCl apps in the Chrome Web Store have been compiled for ARM. If you
use this sort of app, then you probably ought to pick an x86 Chromebook for
better compatibility.

The preview for the new Google Maps would occasionally crash with WebGL-related
issues, but these were difficult to reproduce reliably.

I have a fairly long Google password, which makes waking and unlocking the
Chromebook less than convenient.

### The Ugly

This Chromebook model has a USB 2.0 port and a USB 3.0 port. Unfortunately, even
as of Chrome 29, there is no UI to browse and manipulate the contents of a
modern Android smartphone (via MTP or PTP). This is really strange and very
disappointing. Why wouldn't two Google devices want to get along?

### Summary

If everything you want to do is on the web then this might very well be the
perfect travelling companion. That is, as long as you can keep it fed with
Wi-Fi. Without a network connection, Chrome OS doesn't offer a whole lot.

I really appreciated having the power of a desktop web browser, as there are
some activities that just aren't pleasant or even feasible on a tablet or phone.
Now that I'm back home, however, I'll probably have trouble thinking of ways to
use it.

Of course, if I get bored and adventurous, I could always try installing a real
Linux distribution [just like PJ @ Groklaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130707160346164).
