I came across [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) a while back,
thanks to [episode 127 of The Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/127/).
It's worked well for me,
and it just plain seems like a good idea.
I thought there surely would be something similar for contributors' guides,
but some quick searches didn't yield any.

So,
I put together a template for my own use,
and felt it could be useful for others.
You can find it here:

If you think I'm missing something that could benefit others,
then feel free to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jokeyrhyme/keep-contributing/pulls) or otherwise suggest modifications and additions in a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jokeyrhyme/keep-contributing/issues).
