### Google Slides

You can find my slides here:

-   [2016Q3 Adventures with AWS ECS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xEJuQ7JL-xyZD5Q6Y2lqSK2Cznwfefxl10ifGCYbepg/edit)

I put these together whilst playing with AWS ECS last week,
and figured I'd share them in case anyone else found them interesting.

I left some extra thoughts in the slide notes,
be sure to check those out.
